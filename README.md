# Tableau-Story
This is the eighth project for Data Analyst Nanodegree Program - Udacity

In this project, I created a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set (Baseball Data). My work reflected the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
